## What Worked Well

I got everything mostly working. I feel like I trult learned what goes on behind the scenes when creating a web application. I have dealt with package, babel, and node errors before, but never truly understood them and just followed stackoverflow blindly.

## What Didn't

Eslint does not seem to be fully working. I think this is due to problems I caused by changing vscode settings in the past, I will come to office hours soon to hopefully get help in fixing it.
