## What Worked Well

In the end, almost everything went according to plan. I felt like I got to better understand how react works.

## What Didn't

I am still having some problems with the linter on my computer. I talked to Tim about it and we could not figure it out. I will try uninstalling and reinstalling vscode this weekend.

## Extra Credit

I added a little extra css/styling.
